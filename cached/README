This directory contains a caching framework to take dynamic pages
created by django and mirror them to static html pages for faster
serving by apache.

This system works by renaming the django urls for /home, /popular, and
/newest to /dhome, /dpopular, and /dnewest.  Using the Location
directive for apache conf, /home, /popular, and /newest get mapped to
/var/www/youbama.  /var/www/youbama/home, /var/www/youbama/popular,
/var/www/youbama/newest are symlinks into
/var/www/youbama/cached/home, /var/www/youbama/cached/popular, and
/var/www/youbama/cached/newest, both of which are populated by
update.pl.

Apache serves static pages for /popular and /newest while the
update.pl script fetches the dynamic content periodically from django
and updates the static content.


To install, place the following in /etc/rc.local:

{{{ nohup /var/www/youbama/cached/update.pl & exit 0 }}}

Run update.pl then create symlinks:
ln -s home/1/index.html home/index.html
ln -s newest/1/index.html newest/index.html
ln -s popular/1/index.html popular/index.html

Modify /etc/apache2/sites-available/youbama to add Location directives:

        <Location "/home">
                SetHandler None
        </Location>

        <Location "/popular">
                SetHandler None
        </Location>

        <Location "/newest">
                SetHandler None
        </Location>
