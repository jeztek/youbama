==== Youbama - The Citizen Generated Campaign ====


=== ABOUT ===

This is the source code for youbama.com, a grassroots campaign effort for presidential candidate Barack Obama.   Users can submit videos to the site explaining why they are voting for Obama and can vote for the videos they like.  Popular videos for the day are presented on the landing page.  

The site was rapidly developed in <2 weeks so don't expect polish here.  The site depends on the Django web framework and PHP.  YouTube is used for video hosting.
